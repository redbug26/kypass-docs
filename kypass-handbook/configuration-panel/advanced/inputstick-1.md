# InputStick

[InputStick](http://inputstick.com/) is a wireless USB receiver, that turns your Android or iOS device into wireless USB keyboard and mouse. It allows to send keyboard and mouse actions directly to your PC \(or any other USB host\). The PC will not notice any difference between InputStick and "real" USB keyboard. 

Since v4.5, KyPass support the copy/paste of password directly to your desktop via inputStick.
