# URI Schemes

KyPass support various URI schemes in the URL field \(http/https internal and all other schemes in their corresponding iPhone app\)  
[iSSH](http://www.zinger-soft.com/) have URI scheme support !

By typing &lt;username&gt; or &lt;password&gt; in the http field, &lt;username&gt; or &lt;password&gt; will be replaced by their value.

It means that you could enter ssh://&lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@example.com in one of your url field and KyPass will open iSSH with a authenticated session on example.com.
