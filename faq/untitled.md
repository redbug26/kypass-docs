# iOS

## I see on your website that keyfile are supported. How could use it?

Key file could be sent to KyPass:

* via iTunes file sharing,
* via ‘Upload from desktop’.
* or via synchronisation \(but for security reason, it's not advisable\).

The extension of your keyfiles could be change in the configuration panel.
