## I see on your website that keyfile are supported. How could use it?

Key file need to be sent to KyPass via iTunes file sharing or via ‘Upload from desktop’. For security reason, Dropbox is not supported.

The filename have to be the name of your database followed by .key: if your database is database.kdb, the key filename is database.kdb.key
