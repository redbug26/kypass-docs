# The Magic Combo

One feature I love in KyPass Companion is the magic combo ⌥⌘K.

#### Do you know it ?

It allows you to quickly open a website you have saved in KyPass Companion or even open a ssh or vnc session if you used to correct url in your entry.

It’s a big time-saver for me.

Obviously, you could change the shortcut but you understand the main idea.
