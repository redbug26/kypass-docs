# Beta

KyPass iOS is now available via public beta.

You can [join the Testflight public beta via this link](https://testflight.apple.com/join/wlZmOo9t) .

Be careful. Corruption is always possible! Donâ€™t use it with your day 2 day database \(except if you have good backups â€“ via Dropbox for instance\)

Issues for the public beta will be reported [here on github](https://github.com/redbug26/kypass/issues).

I you want to contribute more to KyPass, there is also the **private** beta. The **private** beta teams receive more build than **public** testers. But we ask more feedback ðŸ˜‰ If you want to join this team, feel free to contact us on the Kyuran [forum](https://www.kyuran.be/forum).
